                            for the purposes of the third party crediting or debiting) your Digital Assets from your Wallet in
                            accordance with your Instruction. If you have insufficient Digital Assets in your Wallet to effect

                            fees associated with the Transaction), then we have the right to refuse to effect any Transaction.
                            Pump may also refuse to act on instructions to the extent permitted by these Terms. It is your

                        <p>27.1. Please contact Pump first if you have any concerns with the Services. We
                            would like to address your concerns without resorting to formal legal proceedings, if possible. We
                            will attempt to resolve the dispute internally as soon as possible. The parties agree to negotiate
                            in good faith for a period of one month to resolve the dispute (which discussions shall remain
                            confidential and be subject to applicable rules protecting settlement discussions from use as
                            evidence in any legal proceeding).</p>
                        <p>27.2. In the event the dispute cannot be resolved satisfactorily, and you wish to
                            assert a Claim against Pump, then you agree to set forth the basis of such Claim in writing in a
                            &quot;Notice of Claim,&quot; as a form of prior notice to Pump. The Notice of Claim must (i) describe the
                            nature and basis of the claim or dispute, (ii) set out the specific relief sought, (iii) include
                            your Wallet reference. The Notice of Claim should be submitted to Customer Support. After you have
                            provided the Notice of Claim to Pump, the dispute referenced in the Notice of Claim may be submitted
                            by either Pump or you to arbitration in accordance with the below clause (Agreement to Arbitrate).
                        </p>
                        <p>27.3. For the avoidance of doubt, the submission of a dispute to Pump for
                            resolution internally and the delivery of a Notice of Claim to Pump are prerequisites to
                            commencement of an arbitration proceeding (or any other legal proceeding).</p>
                        <p>27.4. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or

                        <p>27.5. Aside from where Applicable Law requires or provides you with a choice
                            otherwise, you and Pump agree that, subject to the immediately preceding clause above (Notice of
                            Claim and Dispute Resolution Period), any Claim shall be determined by mandatory final and binding
                            individual (not class) arbitration administered by the London Court of International Arbitration
                            (&quot;<strong>LCIA</strong>&quot;) in accordance with the LCIA Rules for the time being in force, which rules

                        <p>27.6. The seat of arbitration shall be London.</p>
                        <p>27.7. Tribunal shall consist of one arbitrator to be appointed in accordance with
                            the LCIA Rules for the time being in force.</p>
                        <p>27.8. The language of the arbitration shall be in English.</p>
                        <p>27.9. You and Pump further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive
                            power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including without limitation any objections with
                            respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Agreement to Arbitrate, or to the arbitrability
                            of any Claim</p>
                        <p>27.10. The arbitration provisions set forth in this clause will survive
                            termination of these Terms.</p>
                        <p>27.11. Any arbitration against Pump must be commenced by filing and serving a
                            Notice of Arbitration in accordance with the LCIA Rules within one year after the date that the user
                            asserting the Claim first found out or reasonably should have found out the alleged act, omission or
                            default giving rise to the Claim (&quot;<strong>Limitation Period</strong>&quot;). For the avoidance of doubt,
                            the Limitation Period shall include the Dispute Resolution Period set out at clause 27.1. There
                            shall be no right to any remedy or relief for any Claim by the user if the Notice of Arbitration in
                            respect of that Claim is not filed and served on Pump within that Limitation Period. If the
                            Limitation Period is contrary to applicable law, the user shall be required to bring any Claim
                            against Pump within the shortest time period permitted by the applicable law. A Notice of
                            Arbitration should be served on Pump in accordance with the Applicable Laws and rules of service.
                        </p>
                        <p>27.12. The parties agree that the arbitration shall be kept confidential. The
                            existence of the arbitration, the existence or content of the Claim, all documents and information
                            provided or exchanged in connection with the arbitration, and any submissions, orders or awards made

                        <p>30.5. You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under the
                            Terms without our prior written consent, which may, in some cases, require additional information to
                            be provided or enhanced due diligence to be performed. However, we may assign or transfer any of our
                            rights or obligations under the Terms at any time to anyone else, including, without limitation, in
                            connection with any merger, acquisition, or other corporate reorganisation involving Pump.</p>
                        <p>30.6. If, at any time, any clause or sub-clause of the Terms is or becomes
                            illegal, invalid, or unenforceable in any respect, neither the legality, validity or enforceability
                            of the remaining clauses or sub-clauses will in any way be affected or impaired.</p>
                        <p>30.7. You agree that we may record any telephone, email and chat conversations
                            with you, as well as any other forms of communications, including communication used to give
                            Instructions or effect Transactions, between you and us, and that the recordings may be used as
                            evidence in any proceedings relating to any agreement with you. These records will be our sole
                            property.</p>
                        <p>30.8. These Terms may be translated into a language other than the English
                            language. Any such translation is provided solely for your convenience. In the event of
                            inconsistency or ambiguity, the English text will prevail.</p>
                        <p>30.9. Other than in relation to Pump Affiliates, nothing expressed or referred to
                            in these Terms will be construed to give any person other than the parties to these Terms any legal
                            or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with respect to these Terms or any clause or
                            sub-clause of these Terms. The Terms and all of its clauses and sub-clauses are for the sole and
                            exclusive benefit of the parties to these Terms and their successors and permitted assigns.</p>
                        <p>30.10. All clauses and sub-clauses of these Terms, which by their nature extend
                            beyond the expiration or termination of these Terms, will continue to be binding and operate after
                            the termination or expiration of these Terms.</p>
                        <p>30.11. Pump is not an agent of you in the performance of these Terms. These Terms
                            shall not be interpreted as facts or evidence of an association, joint venture, partnership, or
                            franchise between the parties.</p>
                        <p>30.12. We will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform as required by
                            these Terms to the extent the delay or failure is caused by a Force Majeure Event.</p>
                        <p>30.13. No delay or omission by us in exercising any right or remedy under the
                            Terms will operate as a waiver of the future exercise of that right or remedy or of any other rights
                            or remedies under the Terms. The rights and remedies provided in the Terms are cumulative and not
                            exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Applicable Law.</p>
                        <p>30.14. In addition to any legal or other remedy available under the Terms or by
                            law, we may set-off any amounts you owe to us under the Terms or otherwise. You must pay all sums
                            that you owe to us free and clear without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction or withholding of any
                            kind, save as may be required by Applicable Law.</p>
                        <p>30.15. If you receive information about another user through the Pump Platform,
                            you must keep the information confidential and only use it in connection with your usage of the Pump
                            Platform and always in accordance with Applicable Law. You must not disclose or distribute any user
                            information to a third party or use the information in any manner except as reasonably necessary to
                            effect a Transaction.</p>
                        <p>30.16. Where you have breached these Terms, Pump may publish, or otherwise provide
                            its users with details of the breach, including any information that you have provided Pump. Pump
                            may only do so where it determines that doing so is necessary for the protection of other users, and
                            consistent with Applicable Law.</p>
                        <p>30.17. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the
                            payments you make or receive, and it is your responsibility to collect, report, and remit the
                            correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that we are not responsible for determining
                            whether any taxes apply to your use of the Pump Platform or for collecting, reporting or remitting
                            any taxes arising from any Transaction or use of the Pump Platform.</p>
