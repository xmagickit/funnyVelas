                            assist us in providing you with the Pump Platform. We do not share your Personal Data with third
                            parties without your consent, except as described in this Privacy Notice or as otherwise required or

                        <p>We may share your Personal Data with third party companies and individuals
                            that provide services on our behalf or help us operate the Site or our business. These third parties

                            business transaction) such as a corporate divestiture, merger, consolidation, acquisition,
                            reorganisation or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy or dissolution.</p>

                        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Retention of Personal Data</h2>
                        <p>We will retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfil the
                            purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory,
                            accounting, or reporting requirements. We determine data retention based on the amount, nature, and
                            sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from an unauthorised user, the purposes
                            for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other
                            means, and applicable legal requirements.</p>
                        <p>Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract
                            between you and us will be retained until such contract has been fully performed. Personal Data
                            collected for our legitimate interests will be retained as long as needed to fulfil such purposes.
                        </p>
                        <p>We may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever you
                            have given consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, we may
                            be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the
                            performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.</p>
                        <p>Once the retention period expires, Personal Data will be deleted (or, where
                            permitted under applicable law, may be de-identified instead). Therefore, the right of access, the
                            right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability (where relevant under
                            applicable law) cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.</p>
                        <p>However not all your Personal Data may be able to be deleted or de-identified;

                        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Links to Third-Party Sites</h3>
                        <p>The Pump Platform may contain links to other websites, mobile applications,
                            and other online services operated by third parties. These links are not an endorsement of, or
                            representation that we are affiliated with, any third party. In addition, our content may be
                            included on web pages or in mobile applications or online services that are not associated with us.
                            We do not control third party websites, mobile applications or online services, and we are not
                            responsible for their actions. Other websites, mobile applications and services follow different
                            rules regarding the collection, use and sharing of your Personal Data. We encourage you to read the
                            privacy policies of the other websites, mobile applications and online services you use.</p>
                        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Data Security</h3>
                        <p>The security of your Personal Data is important to us. We employ a number of
                            administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect the Personal Data we collect.
                            The safety and security of your information also depends on you. We ask you not to share any of your
                            personal security information.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not
                            completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the
                            security of your Personal Data transmitted to the Pump Platform. Any transmission of Personal Data
                            is at your own risk.</p>
                        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Blockchain Transactions</h3>
                        <p>Your use of digital assets may be recorded on a public blockchain, in
                            particular the settlement of your trades in digital assets. Public blockchains are distributed
                            ledgers, intended to immutably record transactions across wide networks of computer systems. Many
                            blockchains are open to forensic analysis which can lead to re-identification of transacting
                            individuals and the revelation of personal data, especially when blockchain data is combined with
                            other data.</p>
                        <p>As blockchains are decentralised or third-party networks which are not
                            controlled or operated by us, we are not able to erase, modify, or alter personal data on such
                            networks.</p>
                        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Overseas Disclosure and Your Privacy Rights</h3>
                        <p>For purposes of relevant data protection legislation, Pump is the Personal
                            Data controller. Pump is a company with operations throughout the world. As a result, Personal Data
                            may be transferred outside the country in which you reside for the purposes identified. Any such

                            protection authorities as providing an adequate level of protection to the Personal Data we process.

                                party.</li>
                            <li>The right to receive your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used and machine readable

                        <p>You are generally entitled to access Personal Data that we hold about you. If
                            you request access to your Personal Data, in ordinary circumstances we will give you full access to
                            your Personal Data. Depending on the nature of the request, we may charge for providing access to
                            this information, however such charge will not be excessive. However, there may be some legal or
                            administrative reasons to deny access. If we refuse your request to access your Personal Data, we
                            will provide you with reasons for the refusal where we are required by law to give those reasons.
